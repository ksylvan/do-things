## Introduction

Welcome to the Do More Things with Warp repository! This is a community-driven collection of practical prompts and examples for [Warp's](https://warp.dev) Agent Mode, as well as [Warp Drive](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive) objects. These examples showcase how developers can leverage Warp's AI capabilities to streamline their workflow, automate tedious tasks, and solve common development challenges.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with Warp, these examples will help you discover new ways to enhance your terminal experience and boost your productivity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended for Next.js 15)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository (choose one method):

   ```bash
   # Using HTTPS
   git clone https://github.com/warpdotdev/do-things.git

   # Or using SSH
   git clone git@github.com:warpdotdev/do-things.git

   cd do-things
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## How to Use These Examples

Each example in the collection is a Warp Drive object that you can use directly in Warp. There are four types of objects:

- **Prompts**: Quick commands and instructions for the AI agent
- **Notebooks**: Interactive step-by-step guides with explanations
- **Workflows**: Complex automation sequences
- **Folders**: Collections of related objects

To use any example:

1. Click on the example card to open its Warp Drive link
2. The object will open directly in your Warp
3. Follow the instructions in the object to accomplish your task

> **Important**: Always review and verify the content of any object before running it. While we strive to provide safe and accurate examples, it's important to understand what commands will be executed on your system.

Learn more about Warp Drive objects in our [documentation](https://docs.warp.dev/warp-drive).
